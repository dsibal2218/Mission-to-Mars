# Mission-to-Mars
**Overview** : We were asked to create a web app that has information about "Mission to Mars". This web app will be pulling in information from other webpages. Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, we were to scrape the lastest news about Mars, facts about it, featured images, some full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images.

Additionally, using Python and HTML skills, we were to create a scraping script "scraping.py", utilize and update our Mongo Mars database, and create an index.html file to create the webpage containing all the information we collected in the module as well as the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.

Lastly, we are to update our web app to make it mobile-responsive, and add at least two additional Bootstrap 3 components to make it stand out.

Below is the snippet of the webapge created:
